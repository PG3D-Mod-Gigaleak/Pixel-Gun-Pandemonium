first off:
	please try to apply the correct lightmaps into every map you can.

second off:
	if a shader is broken or looks wrong please try to find the correct shader or something that looks similar.

third off:
	please try to bake nav meshes for every map that is used for pve gameplay. try to make them similar to the original navmeshes. and make them function well.

ps: I already finished menu_heaven but that means you need to make new materials for normal heaven because it's a different map.
